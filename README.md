This is some sample text that will be rendered!

$$ \phi(\hat{x}, E, t) = \int_{4\pi} \psi(\hat{x}, \omega, E, t ) $$

This is the scalar flux which is the angle integrated term called scalar flux I want to actually compute this!
In the method of discrete ordinance (S$_N$) method we take that continuous integral over all angles and we evaluate it over quadrature.
Lets do a 1D example!

$$ \phi(x, E, t) = \int_{-1}^1 \psi(\hat{x}, \omega, E, t ) \approx \sum_{n=0}^N w_n \psi_n(\hat{x}, E, t)$$
